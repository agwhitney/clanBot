## The intent of clanbot is to manage tagging groups of users without needing to manage roles.

This allows low-level users to create and opt in to groups that they want to be tagged for without having to create explicit taggable-roles within discord. The idea is to save on administration and let users manage themselves.

A secondary objective is to provide useful tools such as reminders.

Progress has been slowed because my personal discord server has no need for this bot!
